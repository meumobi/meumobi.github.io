Passwordless authentication is growing rapidly
If you submit an App to Apple using passwordless authentication


Users put in their phone number and receive an authentication code via SMS. 
requires as well an email or phone confirmation to be able to login in the app.
provide a "demo account".
Passwordless authentication with a magic link via Email.

Apple reviewer gets a "Device verification" message during the review and cannot continue without the verification code I got to my personal email address.

Binary Rejected
> We were unable to sign in to review your app with the demo account information you provided.

> In order for us to continue the review, we need to have a way to verify all app features and functionality. Typically this is done by providing a demo account that has access to all features and functionality in your app. It is also acceptable to include a demonstration mode that exhibits your appâ€™s full features and functionality. Note that providing a demo video showing your app in use is not enough for us to continue the review.
