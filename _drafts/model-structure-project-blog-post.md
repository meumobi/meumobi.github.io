On this blog we use to share our dev experiences, sometimes it's not an easy task to explain how we do or to decide how deep should we dive into details of implementation. Then today I've decided to do a benchmark of posts I like to compare the post structure they use. Examples I've choosen concern Ionic/Angular Apps, hope it should help use to improve own.
