How to upgrade the built-in PHP of your Mac (OsX)

Each Mac has a built-in Apache server that runs a built-in PHP. It's not recommended to upgrade the version of PHP built-in. Other tools and services built into OS X Server use that version of PHP to do parts of their jobs.

If you want your server to run a later version of PHP, you should download and install yourself a separate copy, installed in a different place to where the built-in is.

There are two installations of PHP one is used by apache and the other by the CLI or terminal. To update the one apache uses simply download a bitnami.com or other MAMP installation.  Updating the CLI is much more involved as stated above and has some associated risks.

Exploring the LAMP server of a Mac

To understand the built-in PHP of your Mac the first thing you should do is open your terminal and type in:

```bash
$ php --version
PHP 5.5.34 (cli) (built: Apr 22 2016 19:16:58) 
Copyright (c) 1997-2015 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.5.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2015 Zend Technologies
$ which php
/usr/bin/php
$ php -i | grep "php.ini"
Configuration File (php.ini) Path => /etc
Loaded Configuration File => /etc/php.ini
```

# How to update PHP on Mac OsX
All you need to do to install the whole thing is opening up a Shell and execute the following line, we use as example the latest version PHP 7.1:

```sh
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md
```

Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

$ brew search php |grep curl
https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php

$ composer search curl

On the [Liipâ€™s PHP Mac OsX home page](https://php-osx.liip.ch/) you will find a lot of useful information about your new PHP and available versions.
