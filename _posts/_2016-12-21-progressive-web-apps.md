> 70% of the Post’s traffic now comes from mobile devices. The mobile website is used far more frequently than the Post’s app, with 63% of overall traffic using its mobile website specifically and 7% on the app.
users accessed five times more pages on the new version of the Post’s site than they did on the current version

Shailesh Prakash, chief technology officer for the Washington Post

As consumers access more content on mobile devices, and often from cellular data connections, mobile site speed is increasingly seen as an important differentiator. Speed up sites keep consumers from growing impatient and navigating elsewhere.

## pre-load content
pre-loading content on users’ devices in the background to ensure it’s ready to display quickly as they move around the site. 

## https
In order to use PWA, websites must use a secure web technology known as “HTTPS,”

## Ads
The company’s engineers figured out a way to ensure ads don’t slow down the experience significantly, he said, and Post advertisers should not need to do anything differently on their end.

## publishing strategy
platform publishing” strategy through which it posts content to services such as Facebook, twitter and Apple’s News app, as well as collect and analyze user information.

## Google AMP: Accelerated Mobile Pages
Accelerated Mobile Pages that many publishers have adopted to help load their content more quickly by stripping out code from their pages, for example. Those pages are often linked to from within Google search results.

The Post is using AMP technology also. If a user taps a link to a Post article in Google search results, they will be served up an AMP version of the content, Mr. Prakash said. But if they subsequently tap a link in that article to move to another Post article, they will be directed to the PWA version of its site.

# Features in Native that PWA are not able to access yet

- APNS (Apple push "native" notifications) / HLS (Apple "native" streams)
- Wireless payments (Apple pay, Google Wallet ect)
- Easy offline experience (let's face it, Service workers are capable but not widely supported and lacking in it's implementations and capabilities currently)
- Access to media anywhere on the device without "uploading"
- Inter-app discoverability and communication (think Facebook/Messenger, PWA cannot do that
