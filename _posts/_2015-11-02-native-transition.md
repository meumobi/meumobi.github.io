Mobile apps developed with web technologies aren't as performant as native - we all know that - but we also know that it's possible to reach near-native performance with the right tools. 
"Native Page Transitions" Cordova plugin allows you to tap into your device's native animations and move from view to view with full 60fps jank-free animations! This one plugin removes a huge performance bottleneck when it comes to hybrid apps, since the one place you are most likely to differentiate between hybrid and native is during view transitions.
When your customers download your app, they expect fully native performance regardless of the platform and device they are using
