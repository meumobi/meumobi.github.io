## How do you format code
The code formatting is available in VS Code through the following shortcuts:

- On Windows Shift + Alt + F
- On Mac Shift + Option + F
- On Ubuntu Ctrl + Shift + I

Alternatively, you can find the shortcut, as well as other shortcuts, through the search functionality provided in the editor with` Ctrl +Shift+ P` (or `Command + Shift + P` on Mac), and then searching for format code.
