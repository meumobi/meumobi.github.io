I recently enrolled in iPhone Developer Program as an individual. While adding my first application on iTunes Connect, it prompted me to enter the company name. See the following message.

> Specify the company or developer name to display on the App Store for your apps. The company name cannot be changed, so be sure to enter the correct name.

> Note: The company name defaults to the legal entity name you enter when you enroll in the Apple Developer Program. If you enroll as a company, you can set the company name (distinct from your legal entity name) only once when you add your first app, as described in Creating an iTunes Connect Record for an App. The company name must be a registered DBA or trade name. The company name will be used for all your apps and can’t be changed later. If you enroll as an individual, the company name is the same as your legal name. In the store, the “company name” is used prominently for navigation and to group your apps. Your legal entity name appears as the “seller” of your apps. For example, “Apple” is the company name and “Apple, Inc” is the seller name. When users tap your company name, they see all of the apps you have on the store.
