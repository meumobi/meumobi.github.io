## If custom css could be copied in src/assets folder

> Add a folder css in the src/assets folder. Put your css file there. In the src/index.html file, add this line  <link href="assets/css/yourCssFileName.css" rel="stylesheet"> Then you can refer to anything in the css file in your other pages as what you normally do with web pages.

# Ionic 2 and External Libraries
Use typings https://mhartington.io/post/ionic2-external-libraries/
and check [Ionic 3.3.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/releases/tag/v3.3.0)

> Another optional step is to remove the src/declarations.d.ts file. This is a legacy file introduced early with ionic-angular projects to improve compatibility between TypeScript and third-party libraries. Due to improvements in TypeScript, this file is no longer necessary. By removing this file, the TypeScript compiler will be able to provide more accurate error messages for import statements.

# Protecting Your App With Ionic Auth Guard "ionViewCanEnter()"

> The Ionic Auth Guards are the Ionic version of the [Angular Navigation Guards](https://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/07/18/guards-in-angular-2.html).
But Angular uses a different kind of routing (more of the classic URL routing style) than Ionic, which uses a simplified routing system targeted more towards mobile and the logic of different pages and viewcontroller.
