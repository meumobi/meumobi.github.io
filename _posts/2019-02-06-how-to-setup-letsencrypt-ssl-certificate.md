[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) recommends
>  that most people with shell access use the [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) ACME client. Itâ€™s easy to use, works on many operating systems, and has great documentation.

We'll follow this way of this tutorial. The platform we use is Debian with Apache, but I suppose instructions can be applied for others platforms.

## Install CertBot Client
Certbot is meant to be run on the server where your website is hosted, then Log in the server and run following commands to install CertBot Client:

```
$ wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
$ chmod a+x certbot-auto
```

## Generate Certificates

./certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/html/ -d vps.meumobi.com -d ww.vps.meumobi.com

mkdir -p .well-known/acme-challenge/
echo -n "Testing acme-challenge" >  /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
sudo certbot renew --dry-run

## Redirect for renewal

```
RewriteEngine On
ReweiteRule ^\.well-known\/acme-challenge\/ - [L]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://spucnottingham.org.uk/$1 [R=301,L]
```

```
mod_rewrite with exception
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/page1/test
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/page2
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://mywebsite.com/$1 [R,L]
```
